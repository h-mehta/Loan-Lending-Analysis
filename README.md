# Loan Lending Analysis
 
## Objective:
To identify the risky loan applicants at the time of loan application so that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

Our Hypothesis would be : <br><br>
<b> Null Hypothesis :</b> Client will default on the loan
<br><b> Alternate Hyp : </b>Client will not default

We are trying to reduce the chances of :

1. giving loans to customers who will default ( Type I error )
2. not giving loans to cutomers who will repay the loan ( Type II error )
